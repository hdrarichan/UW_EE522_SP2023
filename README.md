Welcome to the repository for "Qunatum Resource Estimation of Arithmetic Privitives" by Ethan Hansen, Sanskriti Joshi, and Hannah Rarick under the guidance of Prof. Borris Blinov, Dr. Wim van Dam, and Mariia Mykhailova.  In this project, we used the Microsoft Azure Quantum Resource Estimator to estimate the resources required for various multiplication algorithms (Karatsuba, windowed, and legacy). In this repository, you will find the User Manual which  contains the procedures of our project (user_manual.txt) and a folder which contains the code needed to output resource estimations for each algorithm (Karatsuba, windowed, arithmetic (Arithmetic_Azure).
